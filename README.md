In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars and displayed the information in a single HTML page. 

I wrote most of my code using Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Lab. In my code, I used the requests dependencies to scrape most of the data I needed to build my site. To convert the content, I utilized BeautifulSoup and html.parser. I also tried using selenium so I could get a better grasp of different ways to scrape. Once data was scraped, I wrote a web application that would run my HTML file with all of the data I received. 

While writing this code I noticed that using requests dependency is easier than selenium for the context of the data I was getting. I did run into trouble when trying to scrape weather data from Twitter. I believe there were restrictions when retrieving the JSON from their website. Overall, I wanted to understand the concept of web scraping and not necessarily building an aesthetic web app.
